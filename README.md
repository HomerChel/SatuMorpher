# SatuMorpher

SatuMorpher is a free saturation plugin. It mostly saturates sound, but you can also morph between two types of saturation.

Choose one saturation type on the left and one on the right, morph to taste using the **Morph** knob, adjust **Drive**, and blend in some clean signal with **Mix**. There is also an **Oversampling** selector in the lower-left corner.
